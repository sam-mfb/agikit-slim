# @agikit-slim/examples

Example AGI games for testing the agikit-slim toolchain.

## Structure

### eng/
Tests the full decompile → recompile cycle:
- `eng/orig/` - Original compiled AGI game files (tracked in git)
- `eng/src/` - Decompiled source files (generated by `rushx decompile:eng`)
- `eng/build/` - Recompiled game files (generated by `rushx compile:eng`)

### heb/
Tests compilation only (no original compiled game existed):
- `heb/src/` - Hand-written AGI source files (tracked in git)
- `heb/build/` - Compiled game files (generated by `rushx compile:heb`)

**Note:** The Hebrew package currently compiles successfully, but the text will be nonsensical because Hebrew encoding is not yet implemented.

## Scripts

```bash
rushx decompile:eng       # Extract eng/orig → eng/src
rushx compile:eng         # Compile eng/src → eng/build
rushx compile:heb         # Compile heb/src → heb/build
rushx build-and-zip:eng   # Compile eng and create eng-agi.zip
rushx build-and-zip:heb   # Compile heb and create heb-agi.zip
```
