## Code from agikit (Nat Budin)

This project is a fork of https://github.com/nbudin/agikit by Nat Budin.

**License Status:** The original agikit repository does not contain explicit license
information. Users should contact the original author (Nat Budin) or consult the
original repository for licensing terms before using or distributing code that
originated from that project.

## Code from AGI Studio

Portions of the code in the `packages/core` directory may be derived from or based
on AGI Studio (https://agistudio.sourceforge.net/), which is licensed under GPL-2.0.

**License:** GNU General Public License v2.0

Due to the uncertain provenance of code in `packages/core`, it is possible that some
or all of that code may be subject to GPL-2.0 licensing terms.

If you intend to use or distribute portions of this codebase that include code from
the `packages/core` directory, you should:
1. Assume GPL-2.0 applies to that code
2. Verify the licensing of the original AGI Studio project
3. Consult with a legal professional if needed

The full text of GPL-2.0 can be found at: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html

## Summary

- **packages/cli/**: Code written by Sam Davidoff - MIT License (with exceptions for
  any code derived from agikit or AGI Studio)
- **packages/core/**: Mixed provenance - potentially GPL-2.0 from AGI Studio,
  unclear license from agikit, MIT for Sam Davidoff's contributions
- **packages/examples/**: Example game files - MIT License

## Recommendation

Given the licensing complexity, if you plan to use this project:

1. For personal/educational use: Proceed with awareness of the mixed licensing
2. For commercial use: Conduct thorough license verification of all components
3. For derivative works: Assume GPL-2.0 applies to be safe, or isolate MIT-licensed
   components
